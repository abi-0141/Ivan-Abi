Here are the instructions.

Step 1.
Download and install DSU sideloader app from https://github.com/VegaBobo/DSU-Sideloader/releases

Step 2.

Download Lineage OS rooted GSI from https://sourceforge.net/projects/andyyan-gsi/files/lineage-19.x/lineage-19.1-20230611-UNOFFICIAL-arm64_bvS.img.xz/download

Step 3. Download BROM.zip https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gHaHSwurXY6eM8i6XyQu33q49MeVR7xk/view?usp=drivesdk (to be flashed in recovery!)

Step 4.

Copy the modified boot image or custom recovery to /sdcard/ (note this must be redone since you don't share the original SDCard storage)

Step 5.

Open DSU sideloader app and install the downloaded GSI. 
It will show some adb commands which you need to run using adb. 
Once installation is complete you will get a notification to boot to GSI. Press restart to boot into lineage OS
Once 
When the initial setup is completed in lineage os, enable usb debugging and run 

Step 6.

'adb shell'
in the adb shell run 'su'
then run 'dd if=/dev/block/sdc49 of=/sdcard/boot.img; sync'

Now you should have boot.img file in your phone
Install magisk and patch the boot.img

!!!!! NOTE !!!!!!

Uncheck patch VBMETA in boot.img else you'll get stuck at boot!

Step 7.

For flashing boot use:

'dd if=/sdcard/<patched boot file> of=/dev/block/sdc49; sync'

Step 7.1

For custom recovery use:

'dd if=/sdcard/recovery.img of=/dev/block/by-name/recovery; sync

To be safe on A12 after flashing recovery boot into BROM and flash BROM.zip

Once it is complete you should have either root or custom recovery depending on what you selected to flash!

You can discard the GSI boot from the notification, which will delete all the data of lineageOS
On the side note, you can try out custom roms using DSU sideloader. you can have look at list of GSIs available at https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/Generic-System-Image-(GSI)-list.
